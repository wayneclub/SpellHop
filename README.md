# SpellHop
SpellHop is a 2D platformer where the player runs, jumps, and collects blocks that reveal hidden letters. At the end of each level, a river blocks the way. To cross, the player must use the collected letters to guess a 4-letter word. A correct guess clears the level, while three wrong attempts cause the game to restart with a new word.
